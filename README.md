# Overview

I built this small TypeScript project to get comfortable with the language and its core features. The goal was to write something simple but still use classes, typed lists, recursion, and basic error handling in a real program.

TurboTS is a lightweight command-line tool that manages a small list of tasks and shows a couple of recursive functions running in the terminal. It’s a quick way to explore how TypeScript structures code and enforces types while keeping everything easy to follow.

# Development Environment

I used the following tools while building this project:

- Visual Studio Code  
- Node.js + npm  
- TypeScript  
- ts-node for running `.ts` files directly

The project doesn’t use any extra libraries—just standard TypeScript features.

# Useful Websites

Here are a few resources I used while working on the project:

- [TypeScript Documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [W3Schools TypeScript Guide](https://www.w3schools.com/typescript/)
- [DigitalOcean – Starting a New TypeScript Project](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/typescript-new-project)

# Future Work

Some things I might add or improve later:

- Support for saving tasks to a file  
- CLI arguments for marking tasks complete  
- Additional recursion examples or utilities
